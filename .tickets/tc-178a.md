# Port feature ticket_query to Go

Implement the ticket_query functionality in Go. 

Add this line to go/bdd.sh:

```
# Run ticket_query feature tests
godog features/ticket_query.feature
```

## Notes

**2026-01-09T17:32:14Z**

Implemented ticket_query command in Go. Added cmdQuery function that parses ticket YAML frontmatter, converts to JSON, and outputs as JSONL. Supports optional jq filtering. Updated go/bdd.sh to run ticket_query feature tests. All 5 test scenarios pass.
