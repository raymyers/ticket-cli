# Implement migrate-beads in Zig

Complete the stub implementation of migrate-beads command. Import from .beads/issues.jsonl format with proper dependency type mapping (blocks -> deps, parent-child -> parent, related -> links).


## Notes

**2026-01-09T22:28:31Z**

Implemented migrate-beads command in Zig. The implementation reads .beads/issues.jsonl file, parses each line as JSON, maps dependency types (blocks->deps, parent-child->parent, related->links), and creates corresponding ticket files in .tickets/ directory. Tests pass successfully.
