# Lint / checks in python port

Add ruff, ty, pytest.

Add a Makefile to root project with python target that runs these checks.

## Notes

**2026-01-09T12:53:47Z**

Added mypy (1.14.1+) to dev dependencies. Configured ruff (linting, formatting with 100 char line length, py313 target), pytest (testpaths, test patterns), and mypy (strict mode, py313). Created Makefile in root with python target that runs: ruff check, mypy, and pytest. Fixed whitespace linting issues and added type annotations to test functions. All checks now pass.
