# Port feature ticket_status to TypeScript

Implement the ticket_status functionality. Add this line to typescript/bdd.sh:

```bash
# Run ticket_status feature tests
bun test features/ticket_status.feature
```

## Notes

**2026-01-10T03:52:43Z**

Successfully implemented ticket_status feature in TypeScript. Added cmdStatus (already existed), cmdStart, cmdClose, and cmdReopen functions. Updated main() to handle start, close, and reopen commands. Added test line to typescript/bdd.sh. All 9 scenarios in ticket_status.feature pass.
