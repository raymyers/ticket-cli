Successfully implemented Python version of ticket_show feature. All 10 scenarios pass.

Implementation includes:
- ticket_path() function with partial ID matching support
- parse_ticket() to extract frontmatter and body
- load_all_tickets() to build relationship data
- parse_list_field() to parse YAML list fields
- cmd_show() that displays ticket with enhanced parent field and relationship sections (Blockers, Blocking, Children, Linked)

Added test command to python/bdd.sh
