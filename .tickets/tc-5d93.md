# Port feature ticket_listing to Go

Implement the ticket_listing functionality in Go. 

Add this line to go/bdd.sh:

```
# Run ticket_listing feature tests
godog features/ticket_listing.feature
```

## Notes

**2026-01-09T17:51:05Z**

Successfully implemented ticket_listing functionality in Go, including ls, ready, blocked, and closed commands. All 18 BDD test scenarios pass.

**2026-01-09T17:52:10Z**

Learned: The Go implementation uses a TicketData struct with Frontmatter map, Title, and ID fields. Priority is stored as int in frontmatter. Dependencies and links are stored as arrays. The listing commands filter and sort tickets based on status, priority, and dependency relationships.
