# Port feature id_resolution to C

Implement id_resolution functionality in C. Add to c/bdd.sh: behave features/id_resolution.feature


## Notes

**2026-01-12T03:37:43Z**

Successfully ported id_resolution functionality to C. Implemented resolve_ticket_id function that supports exact matches and partial matches (prefix, suffix, substring). Handles ambiguous IDs and non-existent IDs with proper error messages. Implemented show, status, dep, and link commands that use ID resolution. Updated c/bdd.sh to run id_resolution.feature tests. All 10 scenarios (54 steps) passed.
