# Port feature ticket_links to C

Implement ticket_links functionality in C. Add to c/bdd.sh: behave features/ticket_links.feature


## Notes

**2026-01-12T03:41:07Z**

Implemented ticket_links functionality in C with support for: (1) linking multiple tickets together symmetrically, (2) unlinking tickets, (3) idempotent linking, and (4) proper error handling. Added ticket_links.feature to c/bdd.sh and all tests pass.
