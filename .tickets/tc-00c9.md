```

## Notes

**2026-01-09T17:28:13Z**

Successfully ported ticket_creation functionality to Go. Implemented cmdCreate with all options (title, description, design, acceptance, priority, type, assignee, external-ref, parent). Updated go_ticket.sh to build and run from correct directory. Created go/bdd.sh to run BDD tests with Go implementation. All 17 scenarios (74 steps) passed.
