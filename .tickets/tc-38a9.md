# Port feature ticket_show to TypeScript

Implement the ticket_show functionality. Add this line to typescript/bdd.sh:

```bash
# Run ticket_show feature tests
bun test features/ticket_show.feature
```

## Notes

**2026-01-10T01:32:58Z**

Successfully ported ticket_show feature to TypeScript. Enhanced cmdShow function to display ticket relationships (blockers, blocking, children, linked tickets) and enhanced parent field with title comments. Implementation matches Python version behavior and passes all BDD tests.
