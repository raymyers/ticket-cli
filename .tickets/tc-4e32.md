# Port feature ticket_show to Zig

Implement the ticket_show functionality. Add this line to zig/bdd.sh:

```bash
# Run ticket_show feature tests
behave features/ticket_show.feature
```

## Notes

**2026-01-09T21:00:00Z**

Successfully ported ticket_show to Zig. Extended TicketData struct to include links and parent fields. Implemented enhanced show with relationship sections (Blockers, Blocking, Children, Linked) and parent field enhancement. Used Zig 0.15.2 ArrayList pattern with .empty and explicit allocator in append calls.
