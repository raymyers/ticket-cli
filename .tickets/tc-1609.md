# Setup project for C port

Set up the C project structure for ticket-cli port.

Target directory: c/ticket/
Build system: Makefile (consistent with project style)

Project structure:
  c/ticket/
  ├── src/           # Source files
  ├── include/       # Header files
  ├── tests/         # Unit tests
  └── Makefile       # Build configuration

Dependencies to include:
  - libyaml - YAML parsing
  - cJSON or jansson - JSON output for query command
  - libcrypto (OpenSSL) - SHA256 hashing
  - Testing framework: Check or CUnit

Create wrapper script: c_ticket.sh at project root
Compiler: GCC or Clang with C11 standard
Initial entry point: src/main.c with basic argument parsing


## Notes

**2026-01-12T03:31:02Z**

Completed C project setup:
- Created c/ticket/ directory structure with src/, include/, tests/, bin/
- Created Makefile with targets for build, test, check, lint, format
- Created src/main.c with basic argument parsing and command stubs
- Created c_ticket.sh wrapper script at project root
- Created c/bdd.sh for BDD testing integration
- Updated root Makefile with C targets (c-build, c-test, c-check, c-lint, c-format, c-clean, c-bdd)
- Created README.md with dependency documentation
- Created .gitignore for build artifacts
- Created tests/test_main.c template for unit tests
- Successfully built and tested basic functionality (help, version commands work)
- Library dependencies (libyaml, json-c, libcrypto, check) documented but not yet required for basic build
