# Redo dependencies

In these instructions, the dependency parts are too hard to follow. Use "priority instead" showing with the './ticket' command what the invokation is to set priority.

docs/NEW_IMPLEMENTATION.md

Creating the project is prority 1, then the one about setting up checks is 2 along with create and list features. In 3 we have the finalization, testing stuff

## Notes

**2026-01-09T23:54:10Z**

Updated NEW_IMPLEMENTATION.md to use priority instead of dependencies. Changed all ticket creation commands to include --priority flag (1 for setup, 2 for core work, 3 for integration/validation). Removed all references to setting up ticket dependencies with './ticket dep'.
