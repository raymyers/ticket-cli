# Manual smoke test of Go port

Perform manual testing of the Go implementation in a real-world usage scenario.

## Tasks

1. Create a fresh temporary directory
2. Initialize a new ticket repository in that directory
3. Test basic workflows manually:
   - Creating tickets with various options
   - Viewing tickets (show command)
   - Updating ticket status
   - Adding notes to tickets
   - Adding dependencies between tickets
   - Listing tickets with various filters
   - Querying tickets
   - Testing edge cases (invalid IDs, cycles, etc.)
4. Verify the CLI is user-friendly:
   - Error messages are helpful
   - Command output is clear and readable
   - Commands behave intuitively
5. Document any issues found during testing
6. Add notes with test results and observations
7. Confirm the Go implementation works well in actual usage
