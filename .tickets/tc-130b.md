# Port feature ticket_query to TypeScript

Implement the ticket_query functionality. Add this line to typescript/bdd.sh:

```bash
# Run ticket_query feature tests
bun test features/ticket_query.feature
```

## Notes

Implemented ticket query functionality in TypeScript. The query command outputs tickets as JSONL and supports jq filtering. Used spawnSync from child_process to call jq for filtering. Tests pass successfully.
