# Port feature ticket_query to C

Implement ticket_query functionality in C. Add to c/bdd.sh: behave features/ticket_query.feature


## Notes

Implemented ticket_query in C. Added JSON escaping, YAML frontmatter parsing, and jq filtering support via fork/pipe/exec. Updated c/bdd.sh to include ticket_query.feature tests. All tests passing.
