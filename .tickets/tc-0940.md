# Add BDD tests for dep tree sorting order

Add tests that verify specific ordering in dep tree output, not just presence. Should test that children are sorted by subtree depth (shallowest first) then by ID.


## Notes

**2026-01-09T22:31:39Z**

Added 3 BDD test scenarios to verify dep tree sorting order:
1. Children sorted by subtree depth then ID
2. Children sorted by ID when same depth
3. Complex multi-level sorting verification

Also added a new step definition 'the dep tree output should have X before Y' to enable precise ordering assertions. All tests pass successfully.
