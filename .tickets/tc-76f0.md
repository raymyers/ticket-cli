# Port feature ticket_notes to Zig

Implement the ticket_notes functionality. Add this line to zig/bdd.sh:

```bash
# Run ticket_notes feature tests
behave features/ticket_notes.feature
```

## Notes

**2026-01-09T21:07:32Z**

Implemented ticket_notes functionality in Zig. Added handleAddNote function with timestamp generation (ISO 8601 format). The implementation handles partial ID resolution, creates Notes section if missing, and appends timestamped notes. All 7 BDD scenarios passing.
