# Fix memory leak in Zig dep tree command

Use ArenaAllocator to prevent memory leaks in printDepTree. Currently leaks memory when allocating prefix strings and ticket_id dupes for HashMap keys.


## Notes

**2026-01-09T22:17:02Z**

Fixed memory leak in printDepTree by using ArenaAllocator for temporary allocations. This prevents leaks from HashMap keys (ticket_id dupes) and prefix strings. All temporary memory is now cleaned up automatically when arena.deinit() is called.
