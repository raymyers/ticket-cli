# Zig port

Use these instructions to schedule a Zig implementation of ticket CLI:

docs/NEW_IMPLEMENTATION.md


## Notes

**2026-01-09T19:59:50Z**

Created tracking tickets for Zig port following docs/NEW_IMPLEMENTATION.md:

- tc-e0df: Setup project for Zig port
- tc-52d1: Lint / checks in Zig port (depends on tc-e0df)
- tc-ba73: Scope out BDD Zig
- tc-794f: Add full BDD suite to Zig build (depends on tc-ba73)
- tc-90b5: Manual smoke test of Zig port (depends on tc-794f)
- tc-f92d: Spec review vs Zig implementation (depends on tc-794f and tc-90b5)

Dependency chain:
1. tc-e0df (Setup) -> tc-52d1 (Lint/checks)
2. tc-ba73 (BDD Scoping) -> tc-794f (Full BDD suite) -> tc-90b5 (Manual smoke test) -> tc-f92d (Spec review)

The BDD scoping ticket (tc-ba73) contains instructions for creating 10 individual feature port tickets (one per BDD feature file), which should then be added as dependencies to tc-794f.

Next steps: Execute tickets starting with tc-e0df (Setup) and tc-ba73 (BDD Scoping).
