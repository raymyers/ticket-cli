# Add full BDD suite to Go build

Integrate all BDD tests into the Go build system.

**Note**: This ticket should depend on ALL individual feature port tickets created in tc-3cff. Add those dependencies once the feature tickets are created.

## Tasks

1. Ensure `go/bdd.sh` includes all feature tests
2. Create the BDD test script with proper structure:
   ```bash
   #!/usr/bin/env bash
   set -euo pipefail
   
   PROJECT_ROOT="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/.." && pwd)"
   export TICKET_SCRIPT="${PROJECT_ROOT}/go_ticket.sh"
   
   # Run all features with godog
   godog "${PROJECT_ROOT}/features/"
   ```
3. Add `go-bdd` target to root Makefile
4. Run complete BDD suite and verify all tests pass
5. Ensure BDD suite can be run as part of CI/CD
