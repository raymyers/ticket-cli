# Port feature ticket_dependencies to TypeScript

Implement the ticket_dependencies functionality. Add this line to typescript/bdd.sh:

```bash
# Run ticket_dependencies feature tests
bun test features/ticket_dependencies.feature
```

## Notes

**2026-01-10T04:06:02Z**

Implemented ticket_dependencies feature in TypeScript. Added cmdUndep and cmdDepTree functions. Implemented dependency tree sorting by subtree depth (shallower first) then by ID. All 15 test scenarios passing.
